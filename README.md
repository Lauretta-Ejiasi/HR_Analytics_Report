# HR_Analytics_Power_BI_Report

This is a HR report showing employees data by employment status, job satisfaction rating, distance to work, work life balance and year of service.

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, manipulate and analyse raw data to generate useful prescriptive and descriptive insights in Power BI.

Below is a summary of steps used in analysing this report in Power BI:

1.	Data Cleaning: This involved cleaning the data using Power Query. This includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, transforming data types, and filtering columns to include only relevant data.

2.	Data Transformation: After cleaning the data, I performed data transformation operations such as splitting columns, merging tables, creating calculated columns, and applying custom transformations to prepare the data for analysis.

3.	Data Modeling: Once the data was cleaned and transformed, the next step is to create a data model in Power BI. This involves defining relationships between tables, setting up hierarchies, and creating measures and calculated columns to perform calculations and aggregations.

4.	Data Visualization: With the data model in place and data cleaned to a suitable form, the focus shifted to creating compelling visualizations in Power BI. This includes selecting appropriate visualizations such as charts, tables, cards for Key performance metrics. And, to represent the data effectively i applied customized colors, labels, and formatting to enhances the visual's appeal.

5.	Interactive Reporting: After adding visuals to represent the key data points, i proceeded to adding filters, slicers, and drill-through options to allow users to explore the data in different ways. Here i added slicers by gender to interactivity enhance data analysis capabilities and enable users of any level to gain deeper insights from the visualizations.

In summary, this Power BI report process involved cleaning and transforming data the HR data using Power Query, creating a data model, visualizing the data with various visualizations, enabling interactivity for exploration, and facilitating sharing and collaboration for effective communication of insights.
